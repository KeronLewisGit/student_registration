# student_registration
Displays student registration data in printable pdf

Script Built using
PHP
HTML
CSS- Bootstrap

Very simple php script that reads csv and compiles data to printable pdf. At the moment the script is stored in test.php.
The script is not 100% dynamic and changes need to be made based on the columns you want to display.

See sample pdf on how data is to be displayed. 

Sample data from this script is not to for personal use and is only uploaded for display purposes.

Feel free to play around and add any functionality you may see fit!
